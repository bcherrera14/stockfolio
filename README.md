## Summary

This application uses, React, ASP.NET, PostgreSQL, and the IEX stock API to create a full-stack application where a user can buy and sell stocks with fake money. People can create their own profile and are granted $100,000 to purchase their stocks. The goal of this project is to create an application that can store and manipluate data on a database. I learned how to create a dynamic frontend that rendered data based on the user's profile.
